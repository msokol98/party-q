<!-- PROJECT SHIELDS -->
<!--
*** I'm using markdown "reference style" links for readability.
*** Reference links are enclosed in brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ).
*** See the bottom of this document for the declaration of the reference variables
*** for contributors-url, forks-url, etc. This is an optional, concise syntax you may use.

## About The Project

http://3.136.106.200

Motivation for Party Q web application:

You and your friends have different music preferences. Instead of one person controlling the Spotify playlist,
now everyone can add a song or track to the playlist. 


How it works:
* You and your friend authenticate on my website through Spotify (oauth).
* A friend with Spotify premium hosts the party.
* Anyone can join this party and add songs to the queue.
* Chosen songs will play through the host's Spotify app.


### Built With
These are the major technologies that I used to create this web application.

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/)
* [AWS EC2 running RHEL](https://aws.amazon.com)
