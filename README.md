## About The Project

http://3.136.106.200

Motivation for Party Q web application:

You and your friends have different music preferences. Instead of one person controlling the Spotify playlist,
now everyone can add a song or track to the playlist. 


How it works:
* You and your friend authenticate on my website through Spotify (oauth).
* A friend with Spotify premium hosts the party.
* Anyone can join this party and add songs to the queue.
* Chosen songs will play through the host's Spotify app.


### Built With
These are the major technologies that I used to create this web application.

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/)
* [AWS EC2 running Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://aws.amazon.com)
